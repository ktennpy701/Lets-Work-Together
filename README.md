# Lets-Work-Together
Calling out to people to smile, to care, to express your thoughts, to listen when spoken to, to help someone next to you. 
Do you have the answer to what's really important in your life? There's a common saying "it is all in your mind." That is what the coach would say when you are exhausted. After days of training, you can feel the body aching. To some degree you can will yourself to train harder, to minimize the physical pain from reaching the head, the mind. But what if the pain is in the heart, emotionally and directly affecting your mental wellbeing, the mind. It can be so much more painful than the body ach. Blocking this pain seems rather impossible because it hurts everyday, every minute. The victim's family of a plane crash go through this kind of pain. Many are still suffering years later and life is changed forever. Others would be victims maybe persons who were wrongly accused, victims of an unfair policy, reported and unreported they suffered in silence. They feel the pain too, and affecting their mental wellbeing. Over time, we forget to smile, forget to breath the fresh air in the mornings, we forget to love. I want to call out to people to smile, to care, to express your thoughts, to listen when spoken to, to help someone next to you. Try a small change that may make a difference to the persons near you. Filled your life with kindness, that's what really important.
